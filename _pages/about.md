I'm an M.Sc student of Nanotechnology-Nanomaterials from School of Advanced Technologies, Iran University of Science and Technology (IUST), Tehran, Iran and <a href="http://fn.iust.ac.ir/content/31360/Dr.-Sadegh-Sadeghzadeh">Dr. Sadegh Sadeghzadeh</a> and <a href="http://www.iust.ac.ir/page.php?slct_pg_id=3692&sid=20&slc_lang=en">Prof. Mohammad G. Dekamin</a are my co-supervisors.

We are working on Nanomaterial synthesis and industrialization. Scale-up problems exist in industrial processes and makes it harder to make decisions, here we face these problems and try to eliminate them.

As a dream of mine from chiledhood, I like solving problems which I face. I'm glad to cooperate and join technology teams.
